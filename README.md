# Data Quality and Digital Curation (no title set yet)

This is a position paper defining layers of data quality, identifying
areas for improvement, and recommending strategic points of
intervention.  A key question is about how to improve data quality for
long-term "e-science," and how libraries could play a role by applying
curatorial practices to the research domain.

This paper was prepared for the NSF-sponsored 2012 "Curating for Data
Quality" workshop in Arlington, Virginia.  It uses the ACM SIG style.

This is also my first LaTeX project.  Which I am likely to screw up.
Hence version control.
