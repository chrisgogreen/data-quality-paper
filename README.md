# Academic Libraries as Data Quality Hubs

This position paper argues that academic libraries have a critical
role to play serving as data quality hubs on campus, based on the need
for increased data quality for "e-science" and on academic libraries'
record of providing digital curation and preservation
services. Scientific data are shown to be sufficiently at risk to
demonstrate a clear niche for such services to be provided. Data
quality measurements are defined, and digital curation processes are
explained and mapped to these measurements in order to establish that
academic libraries already have sufficient competencies ``in-house''
to provide data quality services. Opportunities for improvement and
challenges are identified as areas that are fruitful for future
research and exploration.

This paper was prepared for the NSF-sponsored 2012 "Curating for Data
Quality" workshop in Arlington, Virginia.  It uses the ACM SIG style.

This is also my first LaTeX project. Be gentle.
