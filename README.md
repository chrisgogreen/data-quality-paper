# Academic Libraries as Data Quality Hubs

Academic libraries have a critical role to play as data quality hubs
on campus, based on the need for increased data quality to sustain
"e-science," and on academic libraries' record of providing curation
and preservation services as part of their mission to provide enduring
access to cultural heritage and to support scholarly
communication. Research data is shown to be sufficiently at risk to
demonstrate a clear niche for such services to be provided. Data
quality measurements are defined, and digital curation processes are
explained and mapped to these measurements in order to establish that
academic libraries already have sufficient competencies "in-house" to
provide data quality services. Opportunities for improvement and
challenges are identified as areas that are fruitful for future
research and exploration.

Originally prepared for the NSF III #1247471 "Curating for Quality:
Ensuring Data Quality to Enable New Science" workshop in Arlington,
Virginia (September 2012), the manuscript has since been revised and
reformatted.
