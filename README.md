# Academic Libraries as Data Quality Hubs

Academic libraries have a critical role to play as data quality hubs
on campus, based on the need for increased data quality to sustain
"e-science," and on academic libraries' record of providing
curation and preservation services as part of their mission to
provide enduring access to cultural heritage and to support
scholarly communication. Scientific data is shown to be
sufficiently at risk to demonstrate a clear niche for such services
to be provided. Data quality measurements are defined, and digital
curation processes are explained and mapped to these measurements in
order to establish that academic libraries already have sufficient
competencies "in-house" to provide data quality
services. Opportunities for improvement and challenges are
identified as areas that are fruitful for future research and
exploration.

Prepared for the NSF III #1247471 "Curating for Quality: Ensuring
Data Quality to Enable New Science" workshop in Arlington, VA, USA.

This is my first LaTeX project (using the ACM SIG style.). Be gentle.
