* On page 3, paragraph 2, second sentence: “Much of this data is
  deposited into disciplinary repositories and data banks that are
  funded by the US government.” Is there a citation for this?

* Formatting: the author makes use of the Microsoft footnote feature,
  rather than inserting endnotes in regular text at the end of the
  article (a JLSC guideline).

* Weak points: the author could include examples of academic libraries
  that have begun tackling these issues. There are also some seminal
  articles about the role of librarians with research data curation
  which are not referenced.

* I have some minor quibbles with the example of Galaxy Zoo. I do
  wonder how easily that could be emulated – not so much in terms of
  technology but in terms of having multiple libraries trying their
  hands at crowdsourcing quality / curation exercises. I wonder if
  that would scale. I felt like the author didn’t really acknowledge
  that challenge.

* If this is a position paper, it feels as if there needs to be a
  stronger up front statement of the author’s position, and then an
  explanation.  As it reads now, it took a while to get to get to the
  author’s argument. This was problematic particularly as the first
  few pages of the paper were background to the research data issue
  and curation activities. I think the paper would benefit greatly
  from moving a summary of the main thrust of the argument right up
  front and then building out the arguments from there.

* It was unclear at times whether the author was trying to distinguish
  curation practices from data quality practices. I may have been
  reading too much into the paper, but I felt at times the author was
  arguing that libraries should reframe how they talk about curation
  services as data quality services in order to make a stronger
  argument for relevance in current research practices. But this was
  never directly stated.

* Are there differences in academic libraries acting as data quality
  hubs rather than curation hubs? Or is it the same thing with a
  different name? My sense is that there are differences but I don’t
  get a very clear sense of this from the paper.
