\section{Gap Analysis / Challenges}
More about what problems we're elucidating and for which we're proposing
solutions.

From wikipedia article on Data Quality: ``One industry study estimated the total cost to the US economy of data quality problems at over US\$600 billion per annum (Eckerson, 2002)''

Science is changing -- how can advances in curation practices aid the
practice of good science?

What is data quality?

How is data quality ensured?

trust networks - how are they different now? japanese research example (more
anonymous), galaxyzoo example (much larger). ``quality indicators'' and
``assurance levels''



\section{The Framework}
A framework for understanding data quality is as follows.  data quality stack,
quality as a function of successive indicators

\begin{itemize}
\item Highest quality data is authentic (``good science:'' reliable
  instruments, sound theoretical frameworks, completeness, validity,
  ontological consistency, accuracy)
\item Evaluation of the authenticity of data requires that data be usable
  (curation; domain-specific tools, repos, and conventions; file formats)
\item Usability of data requires that data be accessible, discoverable
  (metadata), identifiable (citation, management (niche for cultural
  heritage orgs)), and associated with sufficient
  documentation/context to use it (curation processes)
\item Data integrity is required for context, usability, authenticity, and
  quality.
\end{itemize}

underlying assumption: data preservation (integrity) is necessary but not
sufficient for data quality. also: context (curation), usability (identity,
discoverability), trust (authenticity). adds up to quality. related to
``Semantic Web Stack''

\section{Angles of Attack}
Recommendations on ways to resolve the problems above.

need better tools (enumerate what makes 'em better) for curation/data
integrity (does ScholarSphere help?)

value of curation, learning that early, using it early in research process -
tie in to crowdsourcing adding value (galaxyzoo) - hack academic culture in
such a way that good curatorial skills are necessary for good science, need
``data science'' programs that marry scientific methodology with data curation
and retention practices

hacking trust networks, new trust networks, more resilient trust networks
